# ASCII Style Image – Rahul Dravid

## Overview

This project demonstrates how an image can be recreated using **ASCII art** instead of pixels.  
ASCII art represents images using text characters arranged in a way that visually resembles the original picture.

A grayscale-style approach is used to preserve light and dark regions, allowing depth and structure to appear even with plain text.

## What is ASCII Art?

ASCII art is a technique where images are formed using standard keyboard characters such as symbols, letters, and punctuation.  
By varying character density and placement, it is possible to simulate shading, contrast, and contours.

ASCII art was widely used in early computing environments and is still relevant today for creative programming, visualization, and understanding how images can be represented as data.

## About This Project

- The original image is processed into a grayscale-style representation  
- The image data is stored in a fixed-width 2D matrix  
- Each row is decoded into ASCII characters to form the final output  
- The resulting ASCII art closely resembles the original image using only text

This project focuses on clarity, structure, and understanding how visual information can be transformed into a textual format.
